This is my third front-end mentor challenge. The project uses HTML and CSS and is responsive with media queries for mobile and desktop not for laptops as it was not required by the challenge itself.
MMaking grid was a bit challenging. The hamburger menu on mobile doesn't work because I have not learned JS yet.
