This is my third front-end mentor challenge. The project uses HTML and CSS and is responsive with media queries only for mobile and desktop but not for laptops as it was not required by the challenge itself.
Making grid was a bit challenging. The hamburger menu on mobile doesn't work because I have not learned JS yet.
